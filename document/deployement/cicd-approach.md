# Low-Cost Robust CI/CD Architecture for 7-8 Microservices

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a cost-effective, secure CI/CD pipeline architecture for 7-8 microservices using GitHub Actions, AWS EC2, and managed services. The solution prioritizes minimal cost while maintaining enterprise-grade security, reliability, and operational excellence.

## Architecture Overview

### Infrastructure Components

**Compute:**
- 2x EC2 instances (t3.small): UAT + Production ($30/month total)
- Self-hosted GitHub runner on UAT instance (cost optimization)

**Networking:**
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) with path-based routing ($16/month)
- API Gateway for external traffic management ($3.50/million requests)

**Storage & Database:**
- RDS PostgreSQL t3.micro Multi-AZ for shared config ($25/month)
- ECR for container images ($0.10/GB/month)
- S3 for artifacts and logs ($5/month)

**Security & Monitoring:**
- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (free tier)
- CloudWatch Logs and Metrics ($10/month)
- AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data ($0.40/secret/month)

**Estimated Monthly Cost: $90-120**

## Detailed Architecture

### 1. Repository Structure
```
microservice-{name}/
├── .github/workflows/
│   ├── ci.yml                 # Build, test, security scans
│   ├── deploy-uat.yml         # UAT deployment
│   └── deploy-prod.yml        # Production deployment
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── terraform/                 # Infrastructure as Code
├── k8s/ or docker/           # Container orchestration
└── config/
    ├── uat.env
    └── prod.env
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Flow

**Phase 1: Continuous Integration**
1. Code push triggers GitHub Actions
2. Run parallel jobs:
   - Unit tests (Jest/PyTest)
   - Code quality (ESLint/Pylint, SonarCloud)
   - Security scans (Snyk, Trivy, GitLeaks)
   - IaC validation (Terraform plan)
3. Build Docker image
4. Push to ECR with semantic versioning
5. Update deployment manifests

**Phase 2: UAT Deployment**
1. Manual trigger via deployment UI
2. RBAC validation (GitHub Teams integration)
3. Deploy to UAT EC2 via self-hosted runner
4. Health checks and smoke tests
5. Notification to stakeholders

**Phase 3: Production Gate**
1. UAT sign-off required (manual approval)
2. Production deployment with blue-green strategy
3. Automated rollback on failure
4. Post-deployment verification

### 3. Security & RBAC Implementation

**GitHub OIDC Integration:**
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
  with:
    role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/GitHubActionsRole
    aws-region: us-east-1
```

**Role-Based Access Control:**
- **Developers**: Can trigger UAT deployments for their services
- **QA Team**: Can approve UAT sign-offs
- **DevOps/SRE**: Can trigger production deployments
- **Managers**: Read-only access to deployment status

**Security Measures:**
- No long-lived AWS keys
- Encrypted secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Network segmentation with security groups
- WAF protection for public endpoints

### 4. Deployment UI Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React.js with AWS Amplify hosting
- Backend: Node.js API on UAT EC2
- Authentication: AWS Cognito with GitHub OAuth
- Database: RDS PostgreSQL for deployment metadata

**Features:**
- Service selection dropdown
- Real-time deployment logs
- Approval workflow management
- Deployment history and rollback
- Role-based UI components

### 5. Container Orchestration

**Docker Compose Setup per EC2:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports: ["80:80", "443:443"]
    volumes: ["./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"]
  
  microservice-1:
    image: ${ECR_URI}/microservice-1:${VERSION}
    environment: ["NODE_ENV=production"]
    
  microservice-2:
    image: ${ECR_URI}/microservice-2:${VERSION}
    environment: ["NODE_ENV=production"]
```

**Nginx Configuration:**
- Reverse proxy with health checks
- SSL termination
- Rate limiting
- Request routing based on path

### 6. Configuration Management

**Environment-Specific Configs:**
- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for non-sensitive config
- AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials, API keys
- Environment variables injected at container runtime

**Database Configuration:**
- Shared RDS instance with separate databases per service
- Connection pooling and read replicas for performance
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery

### 7. Monitoring & Observability

**Logging Strategy:**
- Application logs → CloudWatch Logs
- Nginx access logs → CloudWatch Logs
- Deployment logs → S3 + CloudWatch
- Log retention: 30 days (cost optimization)

**Metrics & Alerting:**
- CloudWatch custom metrics for business KPIs
- ALB target group health monitoring
- EC2 instance health checks
- SNS notifications for critical alerts

**Cost Monitoring:**
- AWS Cost Explorer integration
- Budget alerts at $150/month threshold
- Resource utilization dashboards

### 8. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

**Backup Strategy:**
- RDS automated backups (7-day retention)
- ECR image replication to secondary region
- Infrastructure as Code in Git (version controlled)
- Configuration backup to S3

**Recovery Procedures:**
- Automated EC2 instance replacement via Launch Templates
- Database point-in-time recovery
- Container rollback to previous stable version
- Cross-region failover capability

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Right-sizing**: Start with t3.small, scale based on metrics
2. **Reserved Instances**: 1-year term for 40% savings after validation
3. **Spot Instances**: For non-critical workloads and testing
4. **S3 Lifecycle**: Move old logs to IA/Glacier
5. **CloudWatch**: Custom retention policies per log group
6. **ECR**: Lifecycle policies to remove old images

## Security Hardening Recommendations

1. **Network Security:**
   - VPC with private subnets
   - NAT Gateway for outbound traffic
   - Security groups with least privilege
   - WAF with OWASP Top 10 rules

2. **Application Security:**
   - Container image scanning (Trivy/Snyk)
   - Dependency vulnerability checks
   - Secret scanning in repositories
   - SAST/DAST integration

3. **Operational Security:**
   - AWS Config for compliance monitoring
   - CloudTrail for audit logging
   - GuardDuty for threat detection
   - Regular security assessments

## Risk Mitigation

**Single Points of Failure:**
- Multi-AZ RDS deployment
- ALB with multiple targets
- Automated instance replacement
- Cross-region backup strategy

**Performance Risks:**
- Auto-scaling groups for EC2
- CloudWatch alarms for proactive scaling
- Load testing in UAT environment
- Performance budgets in CI/CD

**Security Risks:**
- Regular security updates via automation
- Vulnerability scanning in pipeline
- Incident response procedures
- Security training for team

## Success Metrics

**Operational:**
- Deployment frequency: Daily
- Lead time: < 2 hours
- MTTR: < 30 minutes
- Change failure rate: < 5%

**Cost:**
- Monthly AWS bill: < $120
- Cost per deployment: < $2
- Resource utilization: > 70%

**Security:**
- Zero critical vulnerabilities in production
- 100% secret scanning coverage
- Security incident response: < 15 minutes

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approval**: Stakeholder review of this approach
2. **Environment Setup**: AWS account and initial infrastructure
3. **Pilot Implementation**: Start with 1-2 microservices
4. **Iterative Rollout**: Add remaining services progressively
5. **Optimization**: Monitor and optimize based on usage patterns
